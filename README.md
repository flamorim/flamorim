Hello!

I'm an Engineer that, after 25 years working on networks and telecom (Nokia, Cisco, Embratel), decided to move to data science and artificial intelligence areas.

Currently completing "Business Intelligence Master" MBA, focusing on Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, at PUC-RIO.

Besides that, I'm taking several courses at Kaggle, Stanford and talks.
